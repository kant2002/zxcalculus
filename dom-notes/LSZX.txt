For the first time, entangling lattice surgery has in fact recently been experimentally demonstrated [ref]. The two experiments (Bell state generation and quantum teleportation) both use a merge followed by a split. We immediately see in ZX this is a spider [fig a]. We can use this to easily represent and verify what these two experiments are doing (much more simply than the methods used in the paper). For example, the first experiment, Bell state creation, puts two \ket{0} states as inputs to the spider, and using ZX we can verify Bell state creation in a single line [fig b]. (For experiment 2, teleportation, we need extra types of nodes for the measurement feed-forwards, as defined in [45]. Verifying the experiment diagrammatically is, however, then equally simple). The authors of [ref] themselves note that, by using split and merge as basic, they use many fewer operations than if theyâ€™d implemented the equivalent CNOT-based circuit. The power of using ZX to represent these operations will only increase as both theoretical and experimental capabilities continue to grow.
